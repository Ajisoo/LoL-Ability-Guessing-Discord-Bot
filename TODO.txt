--- DONE ---
1. add probability distributions for champ rolling
1.5. add a way to pre-process this info and store it in a file every time refresh is called, so it doesn't have to be calculated every time someone rolls
2. add place to store who has what splash pieces 
7. DEBUGGING: add a way to force a specific champ roll 
9. update people's progress on their collection
3. add special message for when someone completes a splash 
12. "divorce" option
2.7. limit rolls per hour
--- END DONE ----
13. info command (shows full champion) (problem: search by id)
7. add guild key to roll-timer, so roll timer isn't user-dependent but rather server-dependent
   but also we're mainly using this just on Lounge anyways
4. trading?

2.5. store completed splashes also 
9. Consider having multiple of the same piece
5. use reactable embed for champ splash list instead of text
5. trading up system 
9. stretch goal: do animation for progress pic a la roll color
8. stretch goal: add some sort of 'quality' for each roll
6. split bios into 4 pieces as well
???. change harem.json architecture to {user_id:champ_id:{A?,B?,C?,D?}} where A-D are counts?

11???. make everything non-dupe 
    - (note: should forced rolls be allowed to create dupes?)
    - no longer store multiple copies of a skin in harems.json
    - add a 'rolled' set so even through refreshes, we know what's already taken
    - implementation: 
        1. we remove it from pool: note: upon refreshes, immediately update the pool to reflect rolled set
        2. add to rolled set and if someone rolls something in rolled set, we simply keep rolling until they get unclaimed one
